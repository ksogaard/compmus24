For the Spotify corpus of my portfolio, I will analyze the evolution of musical preferences over time, utilizing the dataset compiled from my "Liked Playlist." This playlist displays a collection of tracks that have been my absolute most listened to, spanning back to around 2016 when I was in my teenage years. Gradually augmented over a long period from 2016 till now, this playlist may be used to examine shifts in musical attributes, such as energy or timbre, mirroring my own growth and changing tastes. I hypothesize that an examination of these tracks will reveal a trend toward greater genre diversity, tempo, and a shift toward tracks with higher valence that indicate a preference for "brighter" sounding music over time.

This analysis will also look into outlier tracks within my corpus, notably the addition of some EDM tracks. These songs, influenced by my moving to Europe and more exposure to an electronic music scene, highlight the changes of my musical taste in response to changes in my life and environment. Despite the addition of EDM, as well as other genres, I predict that the corpus will primarily feature a consistent amount of "softer" indie music, that reflects a core preference that has remained throughout the years. The portfolio aims to display a relationship between personal development and musical taste, looking into how external influences and internal growth lead to the evolution of one's musical landscape (soundscape?).
